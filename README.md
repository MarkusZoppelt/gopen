# Gopen

A command line utility for opening files.

Running `gopen <file>` will open a fuzzy search that lets you select the
application to open the file with.

It is the equivalent of opening the file with `open -a <Appname> <file>` but
instead of specifying the application beforehand, the fuzzy finder can be used
to select the app when running.
